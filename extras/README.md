Optional Helpers for Drink
==========================

Those are all for zsh. If some kind user of oh-my-zsh wants to make a module out of these, that would be very much appreciated.

Porting the command completion and drinkrefresh to bash would be awesome too.

_drink
------

Command completion for zsh. Very much recommended. Drop this into your $fpath.

drinkrefresh
------------

Both, a user command and a precmd hook. Provides needed setup for keeping
prompt info up to date and make change detection work.

zshaliases
----------

Handy shortcuts for common commands.
